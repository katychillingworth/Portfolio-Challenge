## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## What I did:
* Webpage includes name, recent photo, links to sections about me, my work, and contact info
* Made links in the nav bar link to corresponding sections
* Made sections included title images
* Added links to the image photos to take user to 'project' webpages
* Played around with the CSS to make it look appealing 

## Things I struggled with and will circle back to:
* Adding media queries. I have tried and tried but can't see any noticeable changes. I will keep researching and learning and circle back to this
